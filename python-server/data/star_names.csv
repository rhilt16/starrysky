This erroneous commentary read, in brief part: ""eirisim...ab ireo"", or, ""[the constellation name] eirisim...[coming] from [the word] ireus"". Apparently in one manuscript of the Latin Almagest, the final word of this commentary, ab ireo, were written on the next line below the constellation title, where the descriptions of the stars begin. Since the first star entered in the Almagest under the constellation Cygnus is β Cyg, the words ab ireo seem to have been confused as a name for this star.

Secondly, in Arabic, ""right forearm"" is spelled correctly as al-dhira al-yumna, which (in contrast to al-yamin) lacks assonance in the last syllable to Alderamin. Therefore, it is more likely that Alderamin is derived from the various medieval Christian abbreviations of muqaddam al-dhira<ain, ""the Preceding One of the Two Cubits, or Forearms,"" which was a name for the Arabic Almagest period (based on pre-Islamic Arabian) for α Gem.

Perhaps as an attempt to explain the significance of al-ghumaisa', as well as that of the surname al-<abur, ""the One Having Crossed Over [a river, etc.],"" for α CMa, an Arabic fable developed associating these and other equally enigmatic star names. According to one version of the  fable, al-ghumaisa and ai-'abur were sisters, and their brother was suhail (α Car). Suhail, in turn, was the suitor of al-jauza' (the feminine pre-Islamic Arabian figure in place of Orion). In coitus, suhail broke the spine of al-jauza', thus killing her, after which suhail fled south. He was followed by his sister al-'abur who ""crossed over"" the Milky Way (where the two stars now lie in the southern sky). Meanwhile suhail's second sister, al-ghumaisa, was left alone north of the Milky Way, weeping, until her ""eyes became bleary."" (The pre-Islamic Arabian name for α CMa was al-shi'ra, of unknown meaning. Apparently it was developed into a dualis form, al-shi'rayan, to accomodate both α CMa and α CMi, with the aforementioned ""surnames"" distinguishing the two.)","Arabic","Kunitzsch, Paul; Smart, Tim (2006).

In Early Modern times this corruption was erroneously attributed to the assumed Arabic word ""bat"" [properly ibt], for ""the Armpit"" of al-jauza', giving rise to the corruption  Betelgeuse"" seen today. Thus by Early Modern times both the ""y"" and ""d"" of the first part of the pre-Islamic Arabian name had become corrupted.) The pre-Islamic Arabian asterism al-jauza' was a feminine figure represented in the stars of what is today Orion. The origin of its name is unclear (as with nearly all of the ancient group of pre-Islamic Arabian names). The root jwz can mean ""middle,"" and the word al-jauza' is structured as a feminine adjective, thus al-jauza' may mean ""the female one, having something about her related to the middle."" There have been different speculations as to what the ""middle"" reference, if that is what it is, could be (for one example). The pre-Islamic Arabians' al-jauza' corresponded to what in other cultures was Gemini among the zodiacal signs. The Arabics subsequently used the indigenous name for both the Greek Orion and Twins, leading to some confusion in star names between the two constellations. An alternative name for the Arabic Almagest period for Orion was al-jabbar, ""the Giant"" and for Gemini, al-taw'aman, ""the Twins.""","Arabic","Kunitzsch, Paul; Smart, Tim (2006).
